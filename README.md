# LoopBack Android SDK

The Android SDK for the [LoopBack](http://docs.strongloop.com/loopback)
framework obviates the need for using the clunky
`AsyncHttpClient`, `JSONObject` and similar interfaces to interact with
a LoopBack-based backend, albeit RESTful. Instead, interact with
your Models and Data Sources in a comfortable, first-class, native manner.

For more information:

 * [Quick Start](http://docs.strongloop.com/loopback#quick-start) - The Quick
    Start guide is the best place for a fresh start. Get your mobile-ready
    backend up and running _fast_, then come back here to drop in Android
    client SDKs.
 * [LoopBack API
    Documentation](http://docs.strongloop.com/loopback#nodejs-api) - Want
    server-side data validation or custom behaviour? This is the place to look.
    Make your LoopBack project do all the work for you on the server and keep
    your client app lean and mean.
